# Welcome to my STATS220 Repo!
## Hello homo sapiens! This is my repo for a stats course I take at The University of Auckland called STATS220.
*My professor in this course is Dr.Anna Fergusson.*

## Here's a little something about me~
* I am currently a undergraduate student at the University of Auckland, specialisation in **Data Science**.
* This is my final year doing this programme. *Yay! I'm nearly there!!*
* I enjoy **playing tennis**, **swimming** and **figure skating**!
* I also love music, movies and musicals. *P.S binge watching TV shows is one of my biggest hobbies*

### I am hoping this account can bring you something academic as well as something artistical~~
So I would put my top 5 movies here:
1. La La Land
2. Bohemian Rhapsody
3. Tár
4. The Pianist
5. Les Misérables

Here's [ a link to a music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ZBdnWbgCc) of a song I love recently!

*The song is called **In Disguise** by **Ashe***
